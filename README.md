Unresolved Issues:  

Notes:	3/02 - Worked on code. Function still within main.cpp, need to create new .cpp and .h file for function and function declaration
			 - Emailed lab partners, shared my sample code to get more help regarding my code.

		3/07 - Emailed lab partners in regards to missing lecture.
		
		3/08 - Emailed lab partners about my attendance for lab, no one else showed, received email from Partner Left and will not make it to lab.
			 - Worked on code a bit, still need to figure out how to set up function.
			 - Sent out Data to Partner Left, and Function and Header file to Partner Right
		
		3/10 - Received email from Partner Left; will work on code tonight.

		3/11 - Communicated with Partner Left and received function. 
			 - My program and function with the new data produces the same results as Partner Left's results. 
			 - Did not hear from Partner Right; decided to share my function with Partner Left.
		
		3/12 - Having trouble calling Partner Left's function into my program.
			 - Partner Left's function is now properly working in my program.
			 - Updated Partner Left with my results and suggested to do a few minor tweaks into their program. 
			 - Got email from Partner Right and will not participate in this assignment. 
			 - Pushing completed assignment onto Github

Purpose:  

Learn to use use arrays.  
Practice your previously learned skills in a group situation.  


Instructions:  

This is a project you will work on with a group of 3 (or 4) students.  

If you have 4 students, you will need to arrange yourselves into a square. The person on your left and right are your immediate partners. Groups of 3 will already have a left and right partner.  

Your assignment is to learn how to create code for others to use and how to use other people's code in your own project. Working with others is often a challenge especially when you haven't worked with them previously. If you know one of your partners from outside the class, you'll need to choose a different partner.  

You will create a function that calculates the "Sample Standard Deviation" on an array of N ints where the value of N is 25 - strlen(your middle name). If you don't have a middle name, strlen will return 0.  

You will need to create an array of random int values you will place into an array in code. DO NOT enter the values through std::cin.  

You will give your function to your right partner and your data to your left partner.  

Likewise, you will receive data from your right partner and a function from your left partner.  

Your function should be placed in .cpp file by itself and include a .h (header) file with the function declaration.  

You should now have 2 sets of data and 2 functions.  

Run all 4 combinations in one program and test that the Sample Standard Deviation functions both produce the same results for the same data set. This means you will have 2 tests, one for each set of data.  

You should compare your results with your partners. They should produce the same results. If not, work out why.  

On your assignment be sure to indicate your left and right partner in this README.md file. This is important and failing to do so will not allow me to check your work possibly resulting in a zero grade.  

Proper submission is extremely important, so be sure to look over the guidelines. You should confirm your submission is correct with the instructor if you have any doubts.
